* Introduction
This is the source code for a simple GPS tracker built using
- an [[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno][Arduino]],
- the [[http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SD_Card_shield_V4.0][SD card shield from seeedstudio]], and
- the [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/746][Ultimate GPS module from Adafruit]].

It uses the following libraries
- SD & SPI library from the Arduino IDE distribution
- Adafruit GPS library

We use ~Make~ to build the project, thanks to the Arduino-Makefile
project.

* Tasks
** Hardware components [1/2]				       :docs:circuit:
*** DONE Logging: Arduino ↔ SD card
Pins used:
- [X] CS: 4 (not sure what this is)
- [X] In: 11
- [X] Out: 12
- [X] Clock: 13

*** TODO Location: Arduino ↔ GPS module
Understand how to connect the board in a circuit with the Arduino
(https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps)
- [ ] Send instructions: PIN?
- [ ] Read/log data: PIN?
- [ ] How do we know when we have a GPS fix?
- [ ] Solder button battery (CR1220) backup
- [ ] Design a simple circuit based on above understanding.

** Software tasks [2/4]						     :coding:
*** DONE Read/write to SD card
Example program can be found in the ~test~ branch.

*** TODO Read GPS data over serial connection
Example ~echo~-ing program from the Adafruit library can be found on
the ~test~ branch.

*** TODO Final assembly
- [ ] SD+GPS: how to combine the logic in the setup()+loop() scheme?
- [ ] On power loss, revert to logging to GPS chip (under button
  battery power backup).  When power is back, retrieve logs, and
  resume logging as before.
